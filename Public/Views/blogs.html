      <h2>Does the literature Nobel to Bob Dylan mean changing times?</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Ajit Balakrishnan’s Blog, on November 2, 2016.</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The announcement last week that the American pop singer Bob Dylan had been awarded the Nobel Prize for literature has raised many eyebrows in the literary world. Is this event an acknowledgement that the word “literature”, which till now, has meant “written works”, especially those considered of “superior or lasting artistic merit”, no longer need be “written” but can also be sung? Or is it an acknowledgement that the printed word no longer reigns? Or even that a felicity in writing is no longer the defining point of learnedness?I remember clearly the day I heard Dylan for the first time. It was 1964, I was in my final year at school in my home town, Cannanore, a small town in the Malabar coast of Kerala, my ears peeled to the music from Radio Ceylon coming out of a Murphy Radio nearly as big as a present-day refrigerator (transistor radios were a few years away). Radio Ceylon, at that time was the only source of international music and news from outside our little nook of India (television was also a few years into the future). Why was I so attentive to the sounds coming out? It was a miraculous time for music and movies with musicians and film makers in a frenzy of creativity and the world seemingly on the precipice of change like it had never been before. In India, for one, “Midnight’s Children”, people like me born right after Independence and in free India, were coming of age and graduating out of high  school. In the United States, Martin Luther King had that year electrified the world with his “I have a Dream” speech, triggering the civil rights movement that would in time lead to a fairer world from African-Americans. Cinema was entering its golden age, with films like Lawrence of Arabia, Psycho and closer 
 home, Mughul-e-Azam, Barsaat ki Raat and Bandini. The world would not be the same place again! We were living in revolutionary times!</p>

      <h2>How to build world-dominating businesses</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Ajit Balakrishnan’s Blog,  September 8, 2016.</h5>

      <p style="text-align:justify;">A few days ago I found myself sitting at the longest table I have ever seen in my life listening to a discussion on what are the technologies that will be influential: what jobs will these jobs create, what jobs will they destroy in the coming fifteen years. One side of this long table was filled by people working for NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India)and my side of the table had a dozen or so people like me: entrepreneurs as well as executives from large Indian business groups, people heading think tanks and management consulting companies. Towards the fag end of this
	  multi-hour meeting of give and take, Dr Arvind Panagariya, the Columbia University economics professor and current head of NITI Aayog raised a question:“What does it take India to produce companies like Google and Microsoft? While there was not enough time to debate this question that day, this questionhas been ringing in my head since then.I guess what the question really meant was what does it take for India to produce world dominating companies, companies that operate in the Information Age (and not smoke stack, mining or real estate businesses), companies which compete on the basis of the sophisticated technologies they employ to make their products easy to use as opposed to companies that compete on the basis of the cheapness of labour
	  employed by them.</p>
